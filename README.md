C - printf
This project is to replicate the C standard library printf() function

What you should learn from this project:

Applying variadic functions
The complexities of printf function
How to use git in a team setting
Hoe to work in a team
Printf function with the printing features of characters (c), strings (s), % (%), octales (0), hexadecimals ( x and X). We also did a binary function (b)

We create a mini function printf like that of the C language, we document with the book the secrets of printf. We use the putchar function of the syscall writer function. and we work with data structures, with a structure called from the main.h

All codes will be compiled this way: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
